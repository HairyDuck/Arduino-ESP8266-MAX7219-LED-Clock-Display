Make sure to double-check the pin assignments and connections with your specific ESP8266 board and MAX7219 LED Module.

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Required Libraries:
  - Adafruit_GFX
  - Adafruit_LEDBackpack
  - WiFiUdp
  - NTPClient

## Circuit Diagram

Include a circuit diagram image here or provide a clear description of the wiring connections between the ESP8266 and MAX7219 LED Module.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Arduino IDE.

3. Install the required libraries via the Arduino Library Manager:
   - Open the Library Manager: `Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries`.
   - Search for each library name mentioned above.
   - Click on each library and click the "Install" button.

4. Connect the ESP8266 board to your computer using a USB cable.

5. Open the `led_display.ino` Arduino script in the Arduino IDE.

6. Set up the Wi-Fi credentials:
   - Replace `your_wifi_ssid` with your Wi-Fi network name (SSID).
   - Replace `your_wifi_password` with your Wi-Fi network password.

7. Upload the sketch to your ESP8266 board.

8. Monitor the serial output to see the current time being displayed.

## Usage

- The LED display will show the current time with flashing separators (:).
- The time will automatically update every second.
- If the time changes to reflect daylight saving, the display will adjust accordingly.
- You can customize the brightness of the LED display by modifying the `matrix.setBrightness()` value in the code (0-15).
